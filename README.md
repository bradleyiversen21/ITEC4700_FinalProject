## Predicting soccer player value based on FIFA 2023 statistics
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can predict the value of soccer players based on their FIFA 23 statistics. This project will leverage machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to extract relevant information from the FIFA 23 database and apply it to predict the value of players in the real-world soccer market. The model will consider various features, such as a player's overall rating, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physicality, and other relevant attributes that are used to evaluate players in FIFA 23.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [FIFA 23 Players Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset), which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information on 18,539 soccer players from around the world, including their basic information, such as name, nationality, club, position, and age, as well as their detailed in-game attributes and statistics from FIFA 23.

The dataset features that will be used in this project include the following:
Player Information: This includes features such as the player's name, nationality, age, club, and position.
In-game Attributes: This includes features such as overall rating, potential rating, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physicality, and other attributes that are used to evaluate players in FIFA 23.
Market Value: This feature represents the estimated value of a player in the real-world soccer market, which will be used as the target variable for the predictive model.
Wage: This feature represents the weekly salary of a player.
Release Clause: This feature represents the amount of money required to release a player from their contract with their current club.
